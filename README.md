# Typicality


This repo accompanies the paper 'Typical Yet Unlikely: Using Information Theoretic Approaches to Identify Outliers which Lie Close to the Mean' https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00338


### Notebooks

Typicality.ipynb provides the code used to generate the main figures in the text.


Mahalanobis_comparison.ipynb shows a comparison between Mahalanobis distance and Typicality for outlier detection on correlated data. 


chi-square_p_values.ipynb provides the code for testing the lengths of multi-dimensional vectors against the chi-square distribution to derive p-values.
